## Bridging Conversations

### Automatic Portal Creation

When you log in, the bridge automatically creates Matrix rooms (portals) for:
- Your recent 1:1 chats
- Group chats you're in
- Team channels you're a member of

Each portal is a Matrix room that bridges to a Teams conversation.

### From Teams to Matrix

**When someone messages you on Teams:**
1. A new portal room is created (if it doesn't exist)
2. You're invited to the room
3. The message appears in the room

**You'll be invited automatically** - just accept the invitation.

### From Matrix to Teams

**To message someone on Teams:**

**Method 1: Use existing portal**
- If you have a portal for that conversation, just use it

**Method 2: Use list commands**
1. Send `list-teams` or `list-chats` to the bridge bot
2. Click on the conversation you want
3. A portal room is created and you're invited

**Method 3: Direct portal creation** (coming soon)
```
create-portal <teams-chat-id>
```

---

## Sending Messages

### Text Messages

Just send messages normally in the portal room. They'll be delivered to Teams.

**Example:**
```
You (in Matrix): Hello from Matrix!
[Message appears in Teams as: "Hello from Matrix!"]
```

### Replies

Use Matrix's reply feature to reply to specific messages.

**How to reply:**
- Most clients: Long-press message ‚Üí Reply

Edit your messages after sending:

**How to edit:**

### Deleting Messages

Delete messages you've sent:

**How to delete:**

## Managing Portals

### Viewing Your Portals

```
list-teams
```
Shows all Team channels with portal status.

```
list-chats
```
Shows 1:1 and group chats with portal status.

### Portal Room Settings

Each portal room has these properties:

**Room name:** Matches Teams conversation name
- Updates automatically when changed in Teams

**Room avatar:** Shows Teams chat/channel icon
- Updates when changed in Teams

**Room members:** 
- Bridge bot (manages bridging)
- Ghost users (represent Teams users)
- You (logged in user)

### Leaving a Portal

**To stop bridging a specific conversation:**
1. Leave the Matrix room (portal)
2. The portal remains inactive
3. New messages won't create a new portal automatically
4. Re-sync or re-list to recreate if needed

### Ghost Users

**What are ghost users?**
- Matrix users that represent Teams users
- Created automatically by the bridge
- Username format: `@teams_<userid>:matrix.example.com`
- Display name matches Teams display name
- Avatar syncs from Teams profile picture

**Ghost users appear in portal rooms** representing their Teams counterparts.

---

## Advanced Features

### Double Puppeting

**What is it?**
Double puppeting lets the bridge send messages as your real Matrix account instead of a ghost user.

**Benefits:**
- Messages appear from your actual Matrix user
- Works in encrypted rooms
- Better integration with Matrix features

**Setup:**
Requires homeserver configuration. Ask your admin or see bridge configuration documentation.

### End-to-Bridge Encryption

**What is it?**
E2BE encrypts messages between your Matrix client and the bridge.

**Enable:**
1. Verify it's enabled in bridge config
2. Portal rooms will be encrypted
3. Messages are decrypted at the bridge before sending to Teams

**Note:** Teams doesn't support E2EE, so messages are unencrypted on Teams side.

### Presence Sync

**Status:** Coming soon

Will sync online/offline status between Teams and Matrix.

### Typing Indicators

**Status:** Coming soon

Will show when someone is typing in Teams conversations.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Performance

- **Sync regularly:** Use `sync` command after joining new Teams/channels
- **Keep portals active:** Don't leave rooms you use frequently
- **Monitor status:** Check `status` occasionally to ensure connection is healthy

### Privacy

- **Be aware:** Messages bridged through this system are visible to bridge administrator
- **E2BE helps:** Use encryption in Matrix for better privacy
- **Teams policies apply:** Your organization's Teams policies still apply to bridged messages

### Troubleshooting

**Messages not appearing?**
1. Check `status` - are you logged in?
2. Try `sync` to refresh
3. Check bridge bot for error messages

**Portal missing?**
1. Use `list-teams` or `list-chats`
2. Click on the conversation to recreate portal

**Bot not responding?**
1. Check bridge is running
2. Try `ping` command
3. Contact bridge administrator

See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) for more help.

### Best Practices

1. **Keep OAuth token fresh:** Re-login if you see authentication errors
2. **Don't spam sync:** Only use `sync` when necessary
3. **Report issues:** Use `help` to find support channels
4. **Update regularly:** Keep bridge updated for bug fixes and features
