# Product Requirements Document: mautrix-teams Bridge

## Overview

The mautrix-teams bridge is a Matrix-Microsoft Teams puppeting bridge that enables seamless bidirectional communication between Matrix and Microsoft Teams. This bridge will allow Matrix users to interact with Microsoft Teams chats, channels, and teams through their Matrix client.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Enable Matrix users to send and receive messages from Microsoft Teams
2. Support both 1-on-1 chats and team channels
3. Provide reliable message delivery with proper error handling
4. Maintain message formatting across platforms
5. Support media attachments (images, files, videos)

### Secondary Goals
1. Synchronize presence information between platforms
2. Support message reactions (emoji)
3. Support message editing and deletion
4. Support threading conversations
5. Provide typing indicators and read receipts

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Organizations using Matrix as their primary communication platform but needing to interact with Microsoft Teams users
- **Secondary**: Individual users who participate in both Matrix and Teams communities
- **Tertiary**: Beeper users wanting Teams integration

## Use Cases

### UC1: Login and Authentication
**Actor**: Matrix User  
**Description**: User authenticates their Microsoft Teams account with the bridge  
**Flow**:
1. User sends `login` command to bridge bot
2. Bridge generates OAuth URL and sends to user
3. User authenticates with Microsoft
4. Bridge receives OAuth callback and stores credentials
5. Bridge confirms successful login to user

### UC2: Receive Teams Message in Matrix
**Actor**: Teams User sending a message  
**Description**: A message sent in Teams appears in Matrix  
**Flow**:
1. Teams user sends a message in a chat or channel
2. Bridge receives notification via webhook/polling
3. Bridge creates or identifies the corresponding Matrix room
4. Bridge sends the message to Matrix as the ghost user
5. Matrix user sees the message in their client

### UC3: Send Message from Matrix to Teams
**Actor**: Matrix User  
**Description**: A Matrix user sends a message that appears in Teams  
**Flow**:
1. Matrix user sends a message in a portal room
2. Bridge receives the Matrix event
3. Bridge translates the message format
4. Bridge sends the message to Teams via API
5. Teams users see the message from the Matrix user

### UC4: Media Sharing
**Actor**: Matrix or Teams User  
**Description**: Users share images, files, or other media  
**Flow**:
1. User uploads media in their client
2. Bridge downloads the media from source platform
3. Bridge uploads the media to destination platform
4. Bridge sends message with media reference
5. Recipients can view/download the media

### UC5: Presence Synchronization
**Actor**: Matrix User  
**Description**: User's online/away/offline status syncs between platforms  
**Flow**:
1. User's status changes on either platform
2. Bridge detects the status change
3. Bridge updates status on the other platform
4. Other users see the updated presence
